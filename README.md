☕ Coffee Shop Console Application

A simple yet interactive C# console-based Coffee Shop application built using do-while loops, conditional logic, and user input handling.

This mini-project simulates a basic ordering system where users can browse the coffee menu, place orders, view totals, and continue shopping until they choose to exit. It's designed to demonstrate my understanding of:

🔁 Looping structures (do-while)

🧠 Decision making (if-else / switch)

⌨️ User input & validation

🖥️ Console UI formatting

🧹 Clean and structured C# code

This project reflects my growing skills in C#, problem-solving, and writing clean, readable code — while showcasing how even simple logic can be used to create an engaging console experience.
